# Introduction
Give a brief description of the design and a summary of the relevant background information related to the topic. Give a rationale about what is needed and why.
Give the reader an overview of what is in the next sections.
Do not put any detailed results of your work here.

# Design Problem
## Problem Definition
Managing personal finances effectively is a common challenge for many individuals, especially students and young professionals. Without clear insights into their income, expenses, and spending habits, people often struggle to make informed financial decisions. This can lead to overspending, missed savings opportunities, and financial stress.
The primary users of this application are individuals who want to track their personal budgets—particularly students, early-career professionals, and anyone aiming to improve their financial literacy and control. This tool is also designed for users with minimal financial background and limited time, who require a simple, reliable solution for budget management.
Solving this problem is significant because financial management is a core life skill that impacts mental health, stability, and future planning. By providing users with a clear and visual overview of their financial behavior, this application promotes responsible spending, savings habits, and ensures that users make better informed decisions about their finances.
Our proposed solution is a user-friendly software application that allows users to input their monthly income and expenses, categorize their transactions, and view visual summaries such as pie charts and bar graphs to analyze their financial health. The system emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and accuracy—making it a practical and empowering tool for everyday financial management.
## Design Requirements
This section has the following three subsections:
### Functions
Provide functions of the design project. Remember that the functions contain verbs.
### Objectives
Provide objectives of the design project. Remember that the objectives are specified as adjectives.
### Constraints
Provide constraints here. Remember that the constraints are binary (either satisfied or not).


# Solution
In this section, you will provide an account of some solutions your team brainstormed to implement and test the project. Some solutions might not have all the desired features, some might not satisfy the constraints, or both. These solutions come up in your mind while you brainstorm ways of implementing all the features while meeting the constraints. Towards, the end you select a solution that you think has all the features, testable and satisfies all the constraints. Remember that an engineering design is iterative in nature! 
## Solution 1
Write a brief description of your first solution and provide the reasons in terms of testing for not selecting this one. 
## Solution 2
This is an improved solution but might not be the final solution that you select. Give a brief description of this solution here. Again focus on its testing attributes. 
## Final Solution
This is the final solution.  Explain why it is better than other solutions (focus more on testing). You may use a table for comparison purposes. After providing the reason for selecting this solution, detail it below.
### Components
What components you used in the solution? What is the main purpose of using individual component? What testing method did you employ for each component? Provide a block diagram (with a numbered caption, such as Fig. 1) representing the connectivity and interaction between all the components.
### Environmental, Societal, Safety, and Economic Considerations
Explain how your engineering design took into account environmental, societal, economic and other constraints into consideration. It may include how your design has positive contributions to the environment and society? What type of economic decisions you made? How did you make sure that the design is reliable and safe to use? 
### Limitations
Every product has some limitations, and so is the case with your design product. Highlight some of the limitations of your solution here. 




# Team Work
Since this is a group project, you must have a fair distribution of tasks among yourselves. To this end, you must hold meetings to discuss the distribution of tasks and to keep a track of the project progress.
## Meeting 1
Time: Month Date, Year, hour: minutes am/pm to hour: minutes am/pm
Agenda: Distribution of Project Tasks

## Meeting 2
Time: Month Date, Year, hour: minutes am/pm to hour: minutes am/pm
Agenda: Review of Individual Progress

## Meeting 3
Provide a similar description here.
## Meeting 4
Provide a similar description here. 

# Project Management
Provide a Gantt chart showing the progress of your work here. Mention all the tasks along with their predecessors. Provide the slack time of each task and identify the critical path.

# Conclusion and Future Work
A summary of what you achieved. Mention all the design functions and objectives that you achieved while satisfying testing requirements?
While keeping the limitations of your solution, provide recommendations for future design improvements.
