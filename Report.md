## Design Problem

### Problem Definition

Managing personal finances effectively is a common challenge for many individuals, especially students and young professionals. Without clear insights into their income, expenses, and spending habits, people often struggle to make informed financial decisions. This can lead to overspending, missed savings opportunities, and financial stress.

The primary users of this application are individuals who want to track their personal budgets—particularly students, early-career professionals, and anyone aiming to improve their financial literacy and control. This tool is also designed for users with minimal financial background and limited time, who require a simple, reliable solution for budget management.

Solving this problem is significant because financial management is a core life skill that impacts mental health, stability, and future planning. By providing users with a clear and visual overview of their financial behavior, this application promotes responsible spending, savings habits, and ensures that users make better informed decisions about their finances.

Our proposed solution is a user-friendly software application that allows users to:

- Input monthly income and expenses  
- Categorize transactions  
- View visual summaries (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs)

The system emphasizes **simplicity**, **clarity**, and **accuracy**—making it a practical and empowering tool for everyday financial management.
