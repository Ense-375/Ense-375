## Introduction
The Personal Budget Tracker is a software application made to support personal financial management. Its primary goal is to provide users with helpful and clear summaries of their income and spending. This information can be accessed easily, encouraging careful budgeting and financial decisions. This report presents a comprehensive overview of the design and development of Budget Tracker, outlining the planning going into the project, the implementation for that planning and the testing methods to evaluate the program.

## Design Problem

### Problem Definition

Managing personal finances effectively is a common challenge for many individuals, especially students and young professionals. Without clear insights into their income, expenses, and spending habits, people often struggle to make informed financial decisions. This can lead to overspending, missed savings opportunities, and financial stress.

The primary users of this application are individuals who want to track their personal budgets—particularly students, early-career professionals, and anyone aiming to improve their financial literacy and control. This tool is also designed for users with minimal financial background and limited time, who require a simple, reliable solution for budget management.

Solving this problem is significant because financial management is a core life skill that impacts mental health, stability, and future planning. By providing users with a clear and visual overview of their financial behavior, this application promotes responsible spending, savings habits, and ensures that users make better informed decisions about their finances.

Our proposed solution is a user-friendly software application that allows users to:

- Input monthly income and expenses  
- Categorize transactions  
- View visual summaries (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs)

The system emphasizes **simplicity**, **clarity**, and **accuracy**—making it a practical and empowering tool for everyday financial management.

### Design Requirements

#### Functions
The functions of the personal budget tracker include:
1. Track Spending: Enable users to input and visualize their weekly and monthly spending
2. Track Income:  Allow users to input and update their monthly income 
3. Set budget Goals: This budget tracker will give users the opportunity to set spending limits and saving goals on specific categories
4. Generate visual summaries: Create pie charts, bar graphs and other visualization tools to help users illustrate their financial health
5. Display budget Overview: Show users a clear overview of their financial behaviour.
6. Protect user information: Ensures users data are protected through encryption and authentication.
7. Categorize spending: Sort expenses and income into custom categories based on type.

#### Objectives
The objectives of the personal budget tracker include:
1. Secure: The application should protect user data and privacy through strong authentication
2. Reliable: The application should consistently perform accurate calculations and store user data securely
3. Efficient: With the personal budget tracker users should be able to manage their finances with minimal effort
4. Easy to use: The application should be intuitive and easy to use for users
5. Accurate: The application should ensure correct recording and analysis of spending and income
6. Responsive: Quick reaction to user inputs and updating visuals quickly are a priority for this application.
7. Flexible: This application should allow users to customize their financial goals to suit their specific needs.
8. Informative: This application should provide meaningful insights to users' financial behaviour.

#### Constraints
These constraints ensure the application meets user needs, remains within scope, and aligns with the ENSE 375 course requirements. They are categorized into project-specific constraints and course-mandated design constraints.

### Platform Constraints
Must support commonly used platforms such as Windows, macOS, and modern web browsers. The application should not depend on any platform-specific installation.

### User Accessibility Constraints
Must accommodate users with limited technical expertise. The user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate for individuals with varying levels of technological literacy.

### Budgetary Constraints
Must avoid the use of paid software or subscription-based services. All development tools, libraries, and frameworks must be free or open-source.

### Functional Constraints
Must include only core budgeting functionality, including:
- Manual entry of income and expenses  
- Categorization of transactions  
- Simple data visualization (e.g., pie charts and bar graphs)

Must not include advanced financial features such as automatic bank syncing, investment tracking, or predictive analytics.

---

In addition to the above, the application must meet at least four design constraints required by the project guidelines:

### Economic Factors
The tool provides a low-cost solution for individuals to manage personal finances, with no hidden costs or reliance on commercial software.

### Reliability
The application must perform accurate calculations and maintain consistent functionality. It will undergo extensive testing, including unit testing, boundary value testing, and equivalence class testing.

### Ethics
All user data will be handled with respect for privacy and security. No sensitive information will be shared or stored externally.

### Societal Impact
By promoting personal financial literacy and responsibility, the tool contributes positively to individual financial health and broader societal well-being.
